# Final-Project
---
## Overview
The idea for this project is to design an application,
encompassing all the techniques and tools learnt throughout the academy.

The project must be built and design to host a `Help Queue` application,
where users will be able to log issues, entering a queue system. 
The project should include the following features;

### Basic Functionality
Create basic functionality for the application, including full CRUD.
Users will be ab   le to:

* Create new tickets and add them to the queue
* View tickets in the current queue from oldest to newest
* Delete existing tickets in the queue
* Update existing tickets in the queue

### Extra Functionality 

#### Solutions
When a ticket is being marked as "Done", 
users should be able to add a solution 
to that ticket, allowing other users to
see the solutions to a problem that has already been solved.

#### Cohorts
Implement a help queue per cohort, 
such that trainees can navigate to their 
cohort to see the help queue specific to their class.

A cohort page should display the trainers and trainees can make up that cohort.

#### Filtering
Users can filter/arrange tickets based on attributes such as:

* Author
* Date Oldest -> Newest
* Date Newst -> Oldest
* Urgency
* Title (alphabetically)
