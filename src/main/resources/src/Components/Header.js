                    Perhaps you're finding certain concepts in the academy difficult to understand or maybe you've hit
                    a roadblock in your project and you need help from a trainer. Leave a ticket with your issue described
                    and someone will get back to you.
                </p>

                    Alternatively look through the resolved tickets and their solutions to see if your issue has already been
